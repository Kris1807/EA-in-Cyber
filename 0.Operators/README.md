## Idea of the "Operations" directory:

Operations is a directory to construct and conclude different fuction for each
needed operation to be used or tried in our runs.

## For example:

CrossoverOpr directory will have the functions for the different crossover
options there could be.

**It is created so our code won't be redundable and complex.**
